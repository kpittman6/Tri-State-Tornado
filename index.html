      March 18, 1925, was one of the most notable severe weather episodes ever observed. 
      This outbreak included the Tri-State Tornado, the longest tracked & deadliest tornado 
      in U.S. history.

      1) Can we create a reasonable representation of this event in a convection-allowing ensemble?<br>
      2) How might changes to the global climate system since 1925 influence a similar event if it occurred today?<br>
      3) How might projected climate change impact a future severe weather outbreak with similar characteristics?

    <p>
      All 30 selected 20CRv3 members supported a tornado outbreak (multiple separate AFWA Tornado swaths > EF0 intensity) in the historical simulations, 
      which overlapped the area of observed storms and hail from March 18, 1925.<br>
      27 of the 30 historical simulations had continuous AFWA Tornado swaths (>EF 0 intensity) that were at least 100 km in length.<br>
      8 of these had a continuous EF0+ AFWA Tornado swath > 250 km, similar in length to the likely continuous portion of the Tri-State Tornado (Johns et al. 2013).<br>
      All ensemble members had cyclic tornado families exceeding 200 km.<br>
      All 30 present day and end 21st century high emission simulations also supported a tornado outbreak across the same region.

    <p>
      These simulations were run using a high-resolution WRF ensemble, using 20th Century Reanalysis Data (version 3), and the Pseudo-Global Warming technique.
